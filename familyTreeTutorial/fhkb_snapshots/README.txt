This file contains snapshots of the FHKB tutorial as described at http://owl.cs.manchester.ac.uk/tutorials/fhkbtutorial/.

For convenience, there is a tweaked version of the FaCT++ plugin for Protege 4.2 that can classify the later stages of the FHKB in reasonable time. 

The file fhkb.owl corresponds to the FHKB at the end of chapter 10 with a merged import closure, that is, it does not require network access when loading it with an ontology editing tool.
